# Js-To-Query-All-Transactions-Fees-For-A-Given-Address
hello ,sir
we use the nodejs to fetch the data from the etherscan.io api to ge all the transaction from the particular address,and sum up the fee.
you just need to clone the filed and npm install express;npm install superagent;npm install superagent-proxy for the required packages.
and set the myAddr in the index.js file,for which you want to query,and run the code by node index.js in the root dir.
you will find the result by http://localhost:3000/
